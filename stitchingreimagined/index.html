      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Because we were unsatisfied with the polarity of the current market’s offerings, this business was born to bridge the traditional and contemporary
        branches of the cross-stitch industry. <br /><br />
        We aim to create something unforgettable by combining the detail of traditional design with the benefits of modern color and spacing.
      </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h3 id="ribbon">Beyond our dedication to a fresh, new style of cross-stitch patterns, we are:</h3>
        <li>
          <b>Devoted to our customers</b> --- We are here for you, not the other way around, and are always looking for feedback on what patterns you want
          designed.
        </li>
        <li><b>Serious about customer satisfaction</b> --- Any issues will be quickly addressed by a real person, not a robot.</li>
        <li><b>Committed to sustainability</b> --- We are cutting down on paper waste and packaging by offering all of our patterns online.</li>
      </div>

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>
        We love cross-stitching and the community that has been built around it. Our dedication to this community is what inspired us to start designing
        patterns and help grow the love of cross-stitch. Our customers and the originality of our patterns will remain our focus for many years to come.
      </p>
      <h3 id="value-words">--- Community - Dedication - Love of stitching - Customer focus - Originality ---</h3>
